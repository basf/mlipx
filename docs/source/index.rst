MLIPX Documentation
===================

:code:`mlipx` is a Python library for the evaluation of machine-learned interatomic potentials (:term:`MLIP`).
It provides you with an ever-growing set of evaluation methods accompanied by comprehensive visualization and comparison tools.
The goal of this project is to provide a common platform for the evaluation of MLIPs and to facilitate the exchange of evaluation results between researchers.
Ultimately, you should be able to determine the applicability of a given MLIP for your specific research question and to compare it to other MLIPs.
