mlipx is designed for evaluating the performance of :term:`MLIP`.
Therefore, mlipx provides you with static and dynamic test recipes to evaluate, which mlip you should use for your specific problem.

The mlipx package is designed to be modular and extensible. This is realized by utilizing the Data as Code concept via :term:`ZnTrack`.
