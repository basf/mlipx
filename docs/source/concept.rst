Concept
=======

:code:`mlipx` is designed for evaluating the performance of :term:`MLIP`.
Therefore, :code:`mlipx` provides you with static and dynamic test recipes to evaluate, which mlip you should use for your specific problem.

The :code:`mlipx` package is designed to be modular and extensible. This is realized by utilizing the Data as Code concept via :term:`ZnTrack`.

Static Tests
------------

Predefined datasets for evaluating new :term:`MLIP` for a comparison of their general performance for specific tasks.

Dynamic Tests
-------------

Select the dataset you are interested in and evaluate the available :term:`MLIP` on it.

Data as Code
------------

TBA (see :term:`ZnTrack`)


Comparison
----------
TBA (using :term:`ZnDraw` and :term:`mlflow`)
