The creation of mlipx began during Fabian Zills internship at BASF SE, where he worked under the guidance of Sandip De. The foundational concepts and designs were initially developed by Sandip, while the current version of the code is a product of contributions from various members of the BASF team. Fabian Zills integrated several of his previous projects and lead the technical development of the initial release of this code. The code has been released with the intention of fostering community involvement in future developments.  We acknowledge support from:
